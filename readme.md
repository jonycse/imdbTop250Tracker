From my own interest I am tracking imdb top 250 movies each day

## Some information:
"imdbtop250.txt" contains latest 250's and "all_file/" directory contains each day's update.
By using configure file "config.py" you will be able to block/unblock some feature.

## Requirements
+ Python 2.7+
+ Beautiful Soap
+ html5lib
